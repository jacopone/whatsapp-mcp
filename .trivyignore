# Development Dependencies - Accepted Risk

# TypeScript/Jest/Testing dependencies
# Location: baileys-bridge/package.json devDependencies

# Transitive Dependencies - Under Investigation
# =============================================================================

# Any transitive dependency vulnerabilities that:
# 1. Don't have available patches yet
# 2. Require major version upgrades that break compatibility
# 3. Are mitigated by our usage patterns
#
# Add specific CVEs below with justification:

# Example format:
# CVE-YYYY-XXXXX
# Package: <package-name>
# Severity: <HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW>
# Justification: <why we're accepting this risk>
# Timeline: <when we plan to address it>

# =============================================================================
# Notes
# =============================================================================
#
# This file is reviewed during security audits.
# All suppressed vulnerabilities should have:
# 1. Clear justification
# 2. Risk assessment
# 3. Remediation timeline (if applicable)
#
# Review this file:
# - After each dependency update
# - Monthly during security reviews
# - When Trivy database is updated
#
# To test Trivy scan with this ignore file:
#   trivy fs --severity CRITICAL,HIGH --ignorefile .trivyignore .
