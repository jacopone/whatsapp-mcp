go build -o whatsapp-bridge *.go
cd ..

npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

### 2. Start the Bridges

```bash
cd /home/guyfawkes/birthday-manager/whatsapp-mcp

**First-time setup**: You'll need to scan QR codes for both bridges:
1. Go Bridge QR: `tail -f whatsapp-bridge/whatsapp-bridge.log`
2. Baileys Bridge QR: `tail -f baileys-bridge/baileys-bridge.log`

Scan both QR codes with your WhatsApp mobile app.

### 3. Verify Everything Works

```bash
./check-bridges.sh
```

You should see both bridges responding with healthy status.

### 4. Restart Claude Code

The MCP configuration in `.mcp.json` has been updated. Restart Claude Code to load the new WhatsApp MCP server.
