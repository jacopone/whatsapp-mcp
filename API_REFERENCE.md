# WhatsApp MCP - API Reference

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-12

> Complete reference for all 75 MCP tools available in the WhatsApp hybrid architecture.

## Introduction

This API reference documents all 75 Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools provided by the WhatsApp MCP unified orchestrator. These tools enable AI agents like Claude to interact with your personal WhatsApp account through a standardized interface.

**Before You Start**:
- Ensure you've completed the [setup process](./README.md#full-installation-guide) for all three bridges
- Both Go bridge (port 8080) and Baileys bridge (port 8081) must be running
- Unified MCP server must be configured in your AI client (Claude Desktop or Cursor)

**How to Use This Reference**:
1. Browse by [category](#category-index) to find relevant tools
2. Check the **Backend** badge to understand which bridge handles the operation
3. Review **Parameters** to understand required inputs
4. Use **Examples** as copy-paste starting points (update JIDs to match your contacts)
5. Refer to **Error Codes** when troubleshooting failures

## Understanding Backend Routing

The unified MCP orchestrator intelligently routes tool requests to the optimal backend:

- **Go Bridge** (56 tools): Primary backend for communities, messaging, contacts, chats, privacy, newsletters
- **Baileys Bridge** (10 tools): Specialized for history sync and business catalog features
- **Hybrid** (2 tools): Combines both bridges for complex operations (e.g., history sync + mark as read)

**Why This Matters**:
- Go bridge must be running for messaging, communities, and most operations
- Baileys bridge only needed for history sync and business catalog queries
- Hybrid tools automatically coordinate both bridges - no manual orchestration required

## Tool Documentation

This section contains comprehensive documentation for all 75 WhatsApp MCP tools, organized by category. Each tool includes complete parameter details, return structures, working examples, error codes, and usage notes.

## 1. Backend Status

Tools for checking the health and status of both WhatsApp bridges.

---

### backend_status

**Category**: Backend Status | **Backend**: Hybrid (both bridges)

Check the health status of both Go and Baileys backends, including sync progress and connection state.

**Parameters**:

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| - | - | - | - | No parameters required |

**Returns**:

```json
{
  "go_bridge": {
    "healthy": true,
    "url": "http://localhost:8080"
  },
  "baileys_bridge": {
    "healthy": true,
    "url": "http://localhost:8081",
    "connected": true,
    "syncing": false,
    "messages_synced": 15234,
    "progress_percent": 100
  },
  "overall_status": "healthy"
}
```

Returns comprehensive health information for both bridges. The `go_bridge` object contains basic health status and URL. The `baileys_bridge` object includes additional sync-related fields: `connected` (WhatsApp connection state), `syncing` (whether history sync is in progress), `messages_synced` (total messages retrieved), and `progress_percent` (sync completion percentage). The `overall_status` is "healthy" only if both bridges are healthy, otherwise "degraded".

**Example**:

```python
# Check overall system health before performing operations
status = backend_status()

if status["overall_status"] == "healthy":
    print("✅ Both bridges operational")
    print(f"Go bridge: {status['go_bridge']['url']}")
    print(f"Baileys bridge: {status['baileys_bridge']['url']}")
    print(f"Messages synced: {status['baileys_bridge']['messages_synced']}")
else:
    print("⚠️ System degraded - check individual bridge status")
    if not status["go_bridge"]["healthy"]:
        print(f"❌ Go bridge down at {status['go_bridge']['url']}")
    if not status["baileys_bridge"]["healthy"]:
        print(f"❌ Baileys bridge down at {status['baileys_bridge']['url']}")
```

**Error Codes**:

- `BRIDGE_UNREACHABLE`: One or both bridges failed to respond → Check that both bridge services are running and accessible at their configured URLs
- `TIMEOUT`: Health check request exceeded timeout → Verify network connectivity and bridge responsiveness

**Notes**: This tool should be called before initiating bulk operations to ensure both backends are operational. The `syncing` field indicates whether history sync is actively running - avoid starting new sync operations if this is `true`. The `messages_synced` count reflects Baileys temporary storage and may differ from the Go database message count until sync is complete.

### get_baileys_sync_status

**Category**: Backend Status | **Backend**: Baileys Bridge

Get detailed status information about Baileys' current history sync operation.

**Parameters**:

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| - | - | - | - | No parameters required |

**Returns**:

```json
{
  "connected": true,
  "is_syncing": false,
  "messages_synced": 15234,
  "chats_synced": 89,
  "progress_percent": 100,
  "is_latest": true,
  "last_sync_time": "2025-10-12T14:30:00.000Z"
}
```

Returns detailed sync status from Baileys bridge. Fields include: `connected` (WhatsApp connection status), `is_syncing` (whether sync is actively running), `messages_synced` (total messages in Baileys temp storage), `chats_synced` (number of chats processed), `progress_percent` (0-100 completion percentage), `is_latest` (whether all history has been retrieved), and `last_sync_time` (ISO timestamp of last sync activity).

**Example**:

```python
# Monitor history sync progress
sync_status = get_baileys_sync_status()

if not sync_status["connected"]:
    print("❌ WhatsApp not connected - check authentication")
elif sync_status["is_syncing"]:
    progress = sync_status["progress_percent"]
    messages = sync_status["messages_synced"]
    print(f"⏳ Sync in progress: {progress}% ({messages} messages retrieved)")
elif sync_status["is_latest"]:
    print(f"✅ Sync complete - {sync_status['messages_synced']} messages available")
    print(f"Total chats synced: {sync_status['chats_synced']}")
    print(f"Last sync: {sync_status['last_sync_time']}")
else:
    print("⚠️ Sync not started or incomplete")
```

**Error Codes**:

- `BAILEYS_UNREACHABLE`: Baileys bridge failed to respond → Verify Baileys bridge is running on port 8081
- `CONNECTION_ERROR`: Network error communicating with Baileys → Check network connectivity and bridge availability

**Notes**: This tool queries Baileys' temporary database which stores messages during history sync. After sync completion, messages should be transferred to the Go database using `sync_history_to_database()`. If `is_syncing` is `true` and `progress_percent` hasn't changed for several minutes, the sync may be stalled - consider using `cancel_sync()` and restarting. The `messages_synced` count represents messages in Baileys temp storage only, not the main Go database.
