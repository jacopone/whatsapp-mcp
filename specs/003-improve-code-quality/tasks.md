# Tasks: Code Quality and Maintainability Improvements

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-improve-code-quality/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: This feature does NOT require new test creation. The 101 existing tests will validate that refactoring preserves behavior.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Paths**: All tasks operate on `unified-mcp/` directory (Python MCP server)
- **Tests**: Existing test suite in `tests/` (no new tests needed, must maintain 100% pass rate)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Prepare development environment for code quality refactoring

- [ ] T001 Checkout feature branch `003-improve-code-quality` from repository root
- [ ] T002 [P] Run existing test suite to establish baseline (`cd unified-mcp && pytest`)
- [ ] T003 [P] Install mypy for development (`pip install mypy>=1.8.0`)
- [ ] T004 Create git checkpoint with message "Pre-refactoring baseline"

**Checkpoint**: Development environment ready, all 101 tests passing

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: No foundational prerequisites for this feature - skip to user story implementation

**Note**: Since this is a code quality refactoring, there are no blocking infrastructure tasks. Each user story can be implemented incrementally.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Proper Package Structure (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

**Goal**: Fix import path hack and establish proper Python package structure with `__init__.py` files

**Independent Test**: Remove `sys.path.insert()` from main.py, run `python -m unified_mcp.main`, verify all 101 tests pass

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: N/A - skipped for this feature
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: Must execute sequentially in priority order (P1 â†’ P2 â†’ P3 â†’ P4 â†’ P5)
  - US1 (Package Structure) MUST complete first - all other stories depend on proper imports
  - US2 (Constants) depends on US1 - needs proper imports to work
  - US3 (Type Checking) can run after US1 and US2 complete
  - US4 (Linting) should run after US3 - linting validates type hints
  - US5 (Documentation) should run after US3 and US4 - docstrings reference types
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Package Structure**: No dependencies - foundational for all others
- **User Story 2 (P2) - Constants**: Depends on US1 (needs proper imports)
- **User Story 3 (P3) - Type Checking**: Depends on US1 (needs proper package structure)
- **User Story 4 (P4) - Linting**: Depends on US3 (linting validates type hints)
- **User Story 5 (P5) - Documentation**: Depends on US3 and US4 (docstrings reference types, validated by linting)

### Within Each User Story

- **US1**: __init__.py files before import conversions, import conversions before testing
- **US2**: Constants file creation before replacements, replacements before validation
- **US3**: Configuration before annotation, annotation before validation
- **US4**: Configuration before fixes, simple fixes before complexity refactoring
- **US5**: Module docstrings in parallel, function docstrings incrementally, validation last

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within US1**:
- T005, T006, T007 can run in parallel (different __init__.py files)
- T012, T013, T014, T015, T016 can run in parallel after T005-T011 (different module files)

**Within US2**:
- T025, T026, T027, T028 can run in parallel (audit different files)
- T034, T035, T036 can run in parallel (replace in different files)

**Within US3**:
- T048, T049, T050, T051 can run in parallel (different backend files)

**Within US5**:
- T080-T087 can run in parallel (different module docstrings)
- T094-T098 can run in parallel (different module function docstrings)

**Note**: User stories CANNOT run in parallel - they have sequential dependencies

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Create all __init__.py files together:
Task: "T005 [P] [US1] Create unified-mcp/__init__.py"
Task: "T006 [P] [US1] Create unified-mcp/backends/__init__.py"
Task: "T007 [P] [US1] Create unified-mcp/models/__init__.py"

# After import conversions in main.py, convert other modules in parallel:
Task: "T012 [P] [US1] Convert imports in routing.py"
Task: "T013 [P] [US1] Convert imports in sync.py"
Task: "T014 [P] [US1] Convert imports in backends/go_client.py"
Task: "T015 [P] [US1] Convert imports in backends/baileys_client.py"
Task: "T016 [P] [US1] Convert imports in backends/health.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Package Structure)
3. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test that `python -m unified_mcp.main` works, all tests pass
4. This MVP provides proper imports - foundational improvement

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup â†’ Environment ready
2. Add User Story 1 â†’ Test independently â†’ Commit (MVP - proper package structure!)
3. Add User Story 2 â†’ Test independently â†’ Commit (Constants centralized)
4. Add User Story 3 â†’ Test independently â†’ Commit (Type safe)
5. Add User Story 4 â†’ Test independently â†’ Commit (Linted and complexity-controlled)
6. Add User Story 5 â†’ Test independently â†’ Commit (Fully documented)
7. Polish â†’ Create PR

Each story adds value incrementally without breaking previous improvements.

### Sequential Strategy (Single Developer)

**CRITICAL**: User stories MUST be implemented in order due to dependencies:

1. Complete Setup
2. Implement US1 (Package Structure) â†’ Test â†’ Commit
3. Implement US2 (Constants) â†’ Test â†’ Commit
4. Implement US3 (Type Checking) â†’ Test â†’ Commit
5. Implement US4 (Linting) â†’ Test â†’ Commit
6. Implement US5 (Documentation) â†’ Test â†’ Commit
7. Polish and create PR

**Do not skip ahead** - each story builds on previous ones.

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel within a phase
- [Story] label (US1-US5) maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story MUST complete before next begins (sequential dependency chain)
- All 101 existing tests must pass after EVERY checkpoint
- Zero breaking changes to public API throughout refactoring
- Commit after each user story completion with clear message
- Validate independently at each checkpoint
- Reference quickstart.md for detailed step-by-step instructions per phase

**Task Counts**:
- Total: 111 tasks
- User Story 1 (Package Structure): 19 tasks
- User Story 2 (Constants): 21 tasks
- User Story 3 (Type Checking): 15 tasks
- User Story 4 (Linting): 16 tasks
- User Story 5 (Documentation): 29 tasks
- Setup: 4 tasks
- Polish: 7 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 35 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phases
