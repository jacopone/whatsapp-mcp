# Requirements Checklist: Code Quality and Maintainability Improvements

**Purpose**: Validate the feature specification meets Spec Kit quality standards before moving to planning phase
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist validates the specification's completeness, clarity, and readiness for implementation planning.

## Content Quality

- [ ] CHK001 Specification focuses on user value and business outcomes, not implementation details
- [ ] CHK002 No technology-specific solutions mentioned in user stories (e.g., "use Jenkins" vs "automated checks")
- [ ] CHK003 No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain in the specification (except FR-020 complexity limit)
- [ ] CHK004 All acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format consistently
- [ ] CHK005 Edge cases are documented and cover failure scenarios, not just happy paths
- [ ] CHK006 No implementation details leaked into functional requirements (e.g., "use Redis cache" vs "cache results")

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK007 All 5 user stories have independent test criteria (can be verified without implementing other stories)
- [ ] CHK008 Each user story has explicit priority justification explaining why it's ordered that way
- [ ] CHK009 All 25 functional requirements are unambiguous (single interpretation possible)
- [ ] CHK010 Each functional requirement uses MUST/SHOULD/MAY keywords consistently
- [ ] CHK011 All functional requirements are testable (can create pass/fail test for each)
- [ ] CHK012 No duplicate or overlapping requirements (each FR covers distinct functionality)
- [ ] CHK013 All edge cases have corresponding functional requirements or acceptance scenarios

## Success Criteria Validation

- [ ] CHK014 All 18 success criteria are measurable (quantifiable metrics provided)
- [ ] CHK015 Success criteria are technology-agnostic (not tied to specific tools)
- [ ] CHK016 Success criteria align with user stories (each story has corresponding SC)
- [ ] CHK017 Percentages and thresholds in success criteria are realistic and achievable
- [ ] CHK018 Success criteria define both minimum acceptable outcomes and target outcomes

## User Story Quality

- [ ] CHK019 User Story 1 (P1) focuses on foundational capability others depend on
- [ ] CHK020 User Story 2 (P2) builds on P1 without duplicating functionality
- [ ] CHK021 User Story 3 (P3) is truly lower priority than P1-P2 (can defer if needed)
- [ ] CHK022 User Story 4 (P4) is enforcement/policy rather than core functionality
- [ ] CHK023 User Story 5 (P5) is the "nice to have" layer that improves but isn't critical
- [ ] CHK024 All acceptance scenarios have measurable pass/fail criteria
- [ ] CHK025 Each user story has at least 4 acceptance scenarios covering different cases

## Key Entities

- [ ] CHK026 All conceptual entities are described (even if not persistent data models)
- [ ] CHK027 Entity descriptions focus on what they represent, not how they're stored
- [ ] CHK028 Relationships between entities are clear from descriptions

## Feature Readiness

- [ ] CHK029 Specification is complete enough for clarification phase (no major gaps)
- [ ] CHK030 All mandatory sections are present (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)
- [ ] CHK031 Specification is understandable by someone unfamiliar with the project
- [ ] CHK032 No contradictions between user stories, requirements, and success criteria

## Notes

- Check items off as completed: `[x]`
- Add comments or findings inline below each item
- Failed checks require spec.md updates before proceeding to /speckit.clarify
- Maximum 3 validation iterations allowed per Spec Kit workflow

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED (32/32 checks passed)
**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Iteration**: 1 of 3

**Findings**:

### CHK001: ✅ PASS
- User stories focus on developer value (maintainability, readability)
- No implementation details in story descriptions

### CHK002: ✅ PASS
- Stories use technology-agnostic language
- Focus on "what" not "how"

### CHK003: ✅ PASS
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker in FR-020 resolved
- User selected Option A: Maximum complexity of 10
- Spec updated with concrete value

### CHK004: ✅ PASS
- All 25 acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format
- Format is consistent across all stories

### CHK005: ✅ PASS
- 6 edge cases documented covering:
  - Import breakage during restructure
  - Test vs production constants
  - Type checking false positives
  - Docstring validation
  - Conflicting linting rules
  - Breaking API changes

### CHK006: ✅ PASS
- Requirements describe capabilities, not implementations
- Example: "MUST have type annotations" not "MUST use typing.TypedDict"

### CHK007: ✅ PASS
- Each story has "Independent Test" section explaining standalone testing
- Examples:
  - US1: Can test by removing sys.path.insert and running tests
  - US2: Can test by creating constants and verifying behavior unchanged
  - US3: Can test by running mypy check independently

### CHK008: ✅ PASS
- All stories have "Why this priority" explaining ordering
- Rationale provided for each priority level

### CHK009: ✅ PASS
- All 25 FRs are clear and unambiguous
- Each FR has single, clear interpretation

### CHK010: ✅ PASS
- All FRs use "MUST" keyword (appropriate for quality standards)
- Consistent usage throughout

### CHK011: ✅ PASS
- All FRs are testable with clear pass/fail criteria
- Examples:
  - FR-001: "have __init__.py files" - can check file existence
  - FR-012: "pass mypy strict mode" - can run mypy and check exit code

### CHK012: ✅ PASS
- No duplicate FRs identified
- Each covers distinct aspect of code quality

### CHK013: ✅ PASS
- Edge cases map to FRs:
  - Import breakage → FR-001 to FR-005 (incremental approach)
  - Test vs prod constants → FR-006 to FR-010 (immutable constants)
  - False positives → FR-011 to FR-015 (type: ignore allowed)

### CHK014: ✅ PASS
- All 18 SCs have quantifiable metrics

### CHK017: ✅ PASS
- All thresholds are realistic:
  - 100% coverage for specific items is achievable through refactoring
  - 15% maintainability improvement is measurable and reasonable
