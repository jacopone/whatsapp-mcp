Test Fixture Contracts for WhatsApp MCP Server Test Suite

This file defines the pytest fixture patterns and interfaces that will be used
across unit, integration, and e2e tests. These are CONTRACTS, not implementations.

Implementation files will be created during the implementation phase:

# ============================================================================
# NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION
# ============================================================================

"""
Implementation Notes:

1. Fixture Scope:
   - session: Docker containers (start once, shared across all tests)
   - function: Most fixtures (default, isolated per test)
   - module: Expensive setup shared within test file

2. Fixture Cleanup:
   - Use yield pattern for automatic cleanup
   - Example:
     @pytest.fixture
     def resource():
         r = acquire_resource()
         yield r
         r.cleanup()  # Always runs, even if test fails

3. Parametrization:
   - Use pytest.mark.parametrize for multiple test cases
   - Use pytest.param(..., id="name") for readable test names
   - Combine with fixtures for powerful test matrices

4. Mocking Strategy:
   - HTTP requests: Use responses library
   - Other objects: Use pytest-mock's mocker fixture
   - Always mock at boundaries (external services, not internal code)

5. Async Tests:
   - Use @pytest.mark.asyncio for async tests
   - pytest-asyncio auto mode detects async tests automatically
   - Fixtures can be async too: async def fixture_name()

6. Test Isolation:
   - Each test MUST be independent
   - No shared state between tests
   - Use fixtures, not global variables
   - Database tests use transactions with rollback

7. Performance:
   - Unit tests: <30s total
   - Integration tests: <5min total
   - Use pytest-timeout for safety net
   - Mark slow tests: @pytest.mark.slow

8. Coverage Measurement:
   - Run with: pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing
   - View HTML report: firefox htmlcov/index.html
   - Branch coverage enabled in pyproject.toml

9. Docker Integration Tests:
   - Use pytest-docker to manage containers
   - docker-compose.yml in tests/integration/
   - Wait for service health before tests
   - Cleanup containers after session

10. Debugging Failed Tests:
    - Use pytest -v for verbose output
    - Use pytest -s to see print statements
    - Use pytest --lf to run only last failed
    - Use pytest -k "test_name" to run specific test
