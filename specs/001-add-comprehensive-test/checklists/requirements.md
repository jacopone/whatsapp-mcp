# Specification Quality Checklist: Comprehensive Test Coverage for WhatsApp MCP Server

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - Spec focuses on WHAT to test (routing, sync, health) and WHY (reliability, confidence), not HOW to implement tests
  - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (coverage %, execution time, failover speed)
  - Assumptions section explicitly states Python/pytest are acceptable (not mandated)

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - User stories clearly explain value: prevent regressions, ensure data integrity, validate failover
  - Success criteria tied to developer productivity (fast feedback, single command execution)
  - Edge cases address real production concerns (data loss, race conditions, partial failures)

- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - User stories use personas (developer, sysadmin, DevOps engineer, QA engineer, SRE, performance engineer)
  - Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format (BDD style, easy to understand)
  - Success criteria are measurable business outcomes (coverage %, execution time, defect detection)

- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - ✅ User Scenarios & Testing (6 prioritized user stories)
  - ✅ Requirements (45 functional requirements across 6 categories)
  - ✅ Success Criteria (14 measurable outcomes)
  - ✅ Key Entities (4 entities: Test Suite, Mock Backend, Integration Test Scenario, Coverage Report)

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - Spec has 0 clarification markers
  - All requirements are specific and testable
  - Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - Each functional requirement specifies exact scenario to test (e.g., FR-001: "test all 5 routing strategies")
  - Acceptance scenarios are concrete and verifiable
  - Success criteria have numeric targets (70% coverage, 80% for routing.py, 30s unit test time, 5min integration time)

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - SC-001: 20% → 70% overall coverage (measurable)
  - SC-002: routing.py 0% → 80% coverage (measurable)
  - SC-005: Unit tests under 30 seconds (measurable)
  - SC-011: Failover within 5 seconds (measurable)
  - SC-012: Handle 100 concurrent operations (measurable)

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - No mention of specific testing frameworks in success criteria
  - Metrics are universal: coverage percentages, execution time, defect detection rate
  - "Developers can run full test suite with single command" (outcome, not implementation)

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - User Story 1: 7 acceptance scenarios for routing
  - User Story 2: 7 acceptance scenarios for sync
  - User Story 3: 8 acceptance scenarios for health
  - User Story 4: 5 acceptance scenarios for hybrid workflows
  - User Story 5: 5 acceptance scenarios for failover
  - User Story 6: 5 acceptance scenarios for concurrency
  - Total: 37 acceptance scenarios

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - 10 edge cases documented covering:
    - Unknown operation types
    - Duplicate message handling
    - Race conditions
    - Empty databases
    - Partial failures
    - Large batch handling
    - Concurrent access to same resources

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - In Scope: Unit tests (routing, sync, health), integration tests (hybrid workflows, failover, concurrency)
  - Out of Scope: Performance benchmarking, load testing >100 ops, bridge internal testing, UI testing, security testing, compliance testing
  - Clear boundary: testing MCP orchestration layer, not underlying bridges or WhatsApp API

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - 7 dependencies listed (bridge availability, Python version, test frameworks, resources)
  - 10 assumptions documented (endpoints exist, test environment capabilities, acceptable tools)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - FR-001 to FR-045 all specify exact test scenarios
  - Each FR maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
  - Requirements grouped by module/test type for clarity

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - P1 (Routing): Critical path for all requests - highest priority
  - P2 (Sync): Data integrity critical - second priority
  - P3 (Health): Foundation for routing decisions - third priority
  - P4-P6 (Integration): Validation of complex scenarios - lower priority but still valuable
  - Each priority level justified with impact explanation

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - All 14 success criteria directly support user story goals:
    - SC-001 to SC-004: Coverage targets for each module (US1-US3)
    - SC-005 to SC-006: Fast feedback loops (US1-US3)
    - SC-011: Failover speed validation (US5)
    - SC-012: Concurrent operation validation (US6)

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - Spec consistently uses "System MUST test..." not "System MUST implement..."
  - Focus on test outcomes, not test code structure
  - Assumptions section explicitly states tools are "acceptable" not "required"
  - Non-functional requirements focus on test characteristics (deterministic, clean up data) not implementation

## Notes

✅ **All checklist items pass - specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`**

**Quality Highlights**:
- Exceptionally detailed with 6 prioritized user stories and 37 acceptance scenarios
- Comprehensive coverage of 45 functional requirements across unit, integration, and concurrent testing
- Clear measurement criteria with specific numeric targets
- Well-scoped with explicit in-scope/out-of-scope boundaries
- Strong focus on business value (reliability, confidence, regression prevention)
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are specific and testable

**Recommendation**: Proceed directly to `/speckit.plan` - no clarifications needed.
