# Tasks: Automated CI/CD Pipeline with Quality Gates

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-add-ci-cd/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: NOT REQUESTED - No test tasks included (infrastructure feature, validation via actual PR testing)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Repository root**: `.github/workflows/`, configuration files
- **Python project**: `unified-mcp/` (pyproject.toml, pytest.ini)
- **Configuration**: `.codecov.yml`, `.semgrepignore`, etc.

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

- [ ] T004 [P] Create `.github/workflows/security.yml` from contracts/security-workflow.yml specification
- [ ] T005 [P] Create `.codecov.yml` configuration file with 70% threshold

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - workflow files exist, user story features can now be added

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Automated Test Execution on Pull Requests (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Checkpoint**: US1 complete - Tests automatically execute on PRs with retry logic, status visible

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Code Quality Validation (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Automatically verify code meets quality standards (formatting, style, type safety, security)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (Phase 1) - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational (Phase 2) completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel after Phase 2 (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order: P1 (US1) ‚Üí P2 (US2) ‚Üí P3 (US3) ‚Üí P4 (US4) ‚Üí P5 (US5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1 - Test Execution)**: Can start after Phase 2 - No dependencies on other stories
- **US2 (P2 - Code Quality)**: Can start after Phase 2 - Independent of US1
- **US3 (P3 - Build Verification)**: Can start after Phase 2 - Independent of US1, US2
- **US4 (P4 - Coverage)**: Can start after Phase 2 - Independent of other stories (uses existing test infrastructure)
- **US5 (P5 - Merge Protection)**: Depends on US1, US2, US3, US4 - Requires all check names to exist before configuring branch protection

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (N/A - no test tasks for infrastructure feature)
- Configuration before verification
- Verification before moving to next story
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**:
- T001 and T002 can run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T003, T004, T005 can all run in parallel (different files)

**Phase 3 (US1)**:
- Sequential execution required (configuration, then verification)

**Phase 4 (US2)**:
- T011-T016 can run in parallel (verification of different workflow sections)

**Phase 5 (US3)**:
- T019-T023 can run in parallel (verification of different build sections)

**Phase 6 (US4)**:
- T025-T029 are sequential (Codecov setup, then configuration)

**Phase 7 (US5)**:
- T032-T036 are sequential (branch protection setup)
- T036 can run parallel with T037-T039 if develop branch exists

**Phase 8 (Polish)**:
- T040-T048, T052 can all run in parallel (different configuration files)
- T049-T051 are sequential (monitoring tasks)

**Across User Stories** (after Phase 2 completes):
- US1, US2, US3, US4 can all be worked on in parallel
- US5 must wait until US1-US4 complete (needs all check names)

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 2 (Foundational)

```bash
# Launch all foundational workflow creation together:
Task: "Create .github/workflows/ci.yml from contracts/ci-workflow.yml specification"
Task: "Create .github/workflows/security.yml from contracts/security-workflow.yml specification"
Task: "Create .codecov.yml configuration file with 70% threshold"
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Code Quality)

```bash
# Launch all verification checks together:
Task: "Verify ci.yml includes ruff format check step"
Task: "Verify ci.yml includes ruff linting step"
Task: "Verify ci.yml includes mypy type checking step"
Task: "Verify security.yml includes Semgrep SAST step"
Task: "Verify security.yml includes Trivy dependency scanning step"
Task: "Verify security.yml includes Gitleaks secret detection step"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T002) - 10 minutes
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T003-T005) - 30 minutes
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T006-T010) - 45 minutes
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Create test PR, verify tests run with retry, status visible
5. **MVP COMPLETE** - Basic CI/CD pipeline functional

**Estimated MVP time**: 1.5 hours

### Incremental Delivery

1. **MVP** (Phase 1-3): Test execution with retry ‚Üí Deploy/Validate
2. **+ US2** (Phase 4): Add code quality + security scanning ‚Üí Deploy/Validate (2 hours total)
3. **+ US3** (Phase 5): Add multi-language builds ‚Üí Deploy/Validate (2.5 hours total)
4. **+ US4** (Phase 6): Add coverage enforcement ‚Üí Deploy/Validate (3.5 hours total)
5. **+ US5** (Phase 7): Add merge protection ‚Üí Deploy/Validate (4 hours total)
6. **Polish** (Phase 8): Optimize and document ‚Üí Final deployment (5 hours total)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers (after Phase 2 completes):

**Single developer** (recommended for infrastructure feature):
- Sequential implementation: US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4 ‚Üí US5 ‚Üí Polish
- Estimated total: 5-6 hours

**Two developers** (if needed):
- Dev A: US1 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US5 (test execution, builds, merge protection)
- Dev B: US2 ‚Üí US4 ‚Üí Polish (code quality, coverage, optimization)
- Coordination required for US5 (needs check names from US1-US4)

**Three+ developers** (not recommended for this feature):
- Infrastructure configuration benefits from single ownership
- Too many cooks spoil the workflow YAML

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Use contracts as templates**: Copy contracts/ci-workflow.yml and contracts/security-workflow.yml exactly (already correct specifications)
2. **Test incrementally**: After each user story, create a test PR to verify that story works
3. **Monitor performance**: Track workflow execution times from first PR onward
4. **Tune security scans**: Expect some Semgrep false positives initially, tune over 2 weeks
5. **Fail-open is critical**: External service failures (Codecov) must not block PRs

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't skip foundational phase**: Workflow files must exist before any story configuration
2. **Don't forget matrix strategy**: Python testing needs both 3.12 and 3.13
3. **Don't hard-fail on Codecov**: Must use `continue-on-error: true` and `fail_ci_if_error: false`
4. **Don't configure branch protection too early**: Wait until US1-US4 complete (all check names exist)
5. **Don't over-tune initially**: Let security scans run 2 weeks before adjusting rules

### Validation Checkpoints

After each phase, verify:

- **Phase 1**: Directories exist, dependencies installed
- **Phase 2**: Workflows visible in .github/workflows/, no YAML errors
- **Phase 3**: Create PR, tests run with retry, status shows within 2 min
- **Phase 4**: Security scans run, findings appear in Security tab
- **Phase 5**: Builds run for all three languages, failures detected
- **Phase 6**: Coverage report appears, 70% threshold enforced
- **Phase 7**: Branch protection blocks failing PRs, allows passing PRs
- **Phase 8**: All optimizations present, documentation complete

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files or verification steps, can run concurrently
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1-US5)
- Each user story should be independently verifiable by creating test PRs
- Contracts (ci-workflow.yml, security-workflow.yml) are complete specifications - use them as templates
- No test code tasks - this is infrastructure configuration, validated via actual PR testing
- Commit after each logical group of tasks (per phase recommended)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Follow quickstart.md for detailed step-by-step instructions
