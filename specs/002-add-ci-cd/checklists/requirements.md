# Requirements Checklist: Automated CI/CD Pipeline with Quality Gates

**Purpose**: Validate the feature specification meets Spec Kit quality standards before moving to planning phase
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist validates the specification's completeness, clarity, and readiness for implementation planning.

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 Specification focuses on user value and business outcomes, not implementation details
  ✓ User stories focus on developer/maintainer needs, not implementation
- [x] CHK002 No technology-specific solutions mentioned in user stories (e.g., "use Jenkins" vs "automated checks")
  ✓ Stories use "system" terminology, not "GitHub Actions" or specific tools
- [x] CHK003 No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain in the specification
  ✓ Confirmed: zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in spec.md
- [x] CHK004 All acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format consistently
  ✓ All 25 acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then structure
- [x] CHK005 Edge cases are documented and cover failure scenarios, not just happy paths
  ✓ Six edge cases documented: CI outage, config changes, force-push, docs-only PRs, multi-module coverage, flaky tests
- [x] CHK006 No implementation details leaked into functional requirements (e.g., "use Redis cache" vs "cache results")
  ✓ FRs describe what system must do, not how (e.g., "execute tests" not "use pytest")

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK007 All 5 user stories have independent test criteria (can be verified without implementing other stories)
  ✓ Each story has "Independent Test" section explaining how to test in isolation
- [x] CHK008 Each user story has explicit priority justification explaining why it's ordered that way
  ✓ All stories include "Why this priority" explanations
- [x] CHK009 All 20 functional requirements are unambiguous (single interpretation possible)
  ✓ Each FR uses clear action verbs and measurable criteria
- [x] CHK010 Each functional requirement uses MUST/SHOULD/MAY keywords consistently
  ✓ All 20 FRs use "MUST" keyword (appropriate for quality gates)
- [x] CHK011 All functional requirements are testable (can create pass/fail test for each)
  ✓ Each FR has clear pass/fail conditions (e.g., "within 2 minutes", "70% threshold")
- [x] CHK012 No duplicate or overlapping requirements (each FR covers distinct functionality)
  ✓ Reviewed all 20 FRs - each covers unique aspect of CI/CD pipeline
- [x] CHK013 All edge cases have corresponding functional requirements or acceptance scenarios
  ✓ FR-015 (manual re-trigger), FR-016 (cancel obsolete runs), FR-019 (skip drafts) map to edge cases

## Success Criteria Validation

- [x] CHK014 All 10 success criteria are measurable (quantifiable metrics provided)
  ✓ All SCs include percentages, time limits, or countable events (100%, 95%, 2 minutes, 10 minutes, 70%, 30%, 80%)
- [x] CHK015 Success criteria are technology-agnostic (not tied to specific tools)
  ✓ SCs describe outcomes (test coverage, check completion) not tools (GitHub Actions, Codecov)
- [x] CHK016 Success criteria align with user stories (each story has corresponding SC)
  ✓ SC-001/002 map to US1, SC-005 to US2, SC-006 to US3, SC-004 to US4, SC-003/010 to US5
- [x] CHK017 Percentages and thresholds in success criteria are realistic and achievable
  ✓ 70% coverage baseline, 2-minute trigger time, 10-minute result time are industry-standard
- [x] CHK018 Success criteria define both minimum acceptable outcomes and target outcomes
  ✓ SC-003 (zero failures), SC-010 (zero broken branches) define minimum; others define continuous metrics

## User Story Quality

- [x] CHK019 User Story 1 (P1) focuses on foundational capability others depend on
  ✓ P1 is test execution - without it, quality checks (P2) and coverage (P4) are meaningless
- [x] CHK020 User Story 2 (P2) builds on P1 without duplicating functionality
  ✓ P2 adds code quality validation (formatting, style, types) separate from P1's test execution
- [x] CHK021 User Story 3 (P3) is truly lower priority than P1-P2 (can defer if needed)
  ✓ P3 build verification catches fewer issues in interpreted languages - documented in priority justification
- [x] CHK022 User Story 4 (P4) is enforcement/policy rather than core functionality
  ✓ P4 coverage enforcement is policy for long-term quality, can be overridden by maintainers
- [x] CHK023 User Story 5 (P5) is the "makes other checks meaningful" layer
  ✓ P5 merge protection enforces all previous checks - "useless without the checks themselves"
- [x] CHK024 All acceptance scenarios have measurable pass/fail criteria
  ✓ All scenarios include observable outcomes (status messages, execution times, error logs)
- [x] CHK025 Each user story has at least 4 acceptance scenarios covering different cases
  ✓ All 5 stories have exactly 5 acceptance scenarios each

## Key Entities

- [x] CHK026 All conceptual entities are described (even if not persistent data models)
  ✓ Four entities documented: Check Run, Check Suite, Coverage Report, Merge Status
- [x] CHK027 Entity descriptions focus on what they represent, not how they're stored
  ✓ Entities described as conceptual workflow states, not database schemas
- [x] CHK028 Relationships between entities are clear from descriptions
  ✓ Check Suite contains Check Runs, Merge Status aggregates Check Results

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK029 Specification is complete enough for clarification phase (no major gaps)
  ✓ All user stories, requirements, success criteria, and edge cases documented
- [x] CHK030 All mandatory sections are present (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)
  ✓ Spec includes: User Scenarios (with priorities), Requirements (20 FRs), Success Criteria (10 SCs)
- [x] CHK031 Specification is understandable by someone unfamiliar with the project
  ✓ No project-specific jargon, clear explanations of PR checks and quality gates
- [x] CHK032 No contradictions between user stories, requirements, and success criteria
  ✓ All elements align: US1→FR001-002→SC001-002, coverage threshold consistent at 70%

## Notes

- Check items off as completed: `[x]`
- Add comments or findings inline below each item
- Failed checks require spec.md updates before proceeding to /speckit.clarify
- Maximum 3 validation iterations allowed per Spec Kit workflow
