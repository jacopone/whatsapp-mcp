# Feature Specification: Automated CI/CD Pipeline with Quality Gates

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-ci-cd`
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and quality gates. Need to: 1) GitHub Actions workflow for PR checks, 2) Run pytest on all PRs, 3) Run ruff linting, 4) Run mypy type checking, 5) Build verification (Go, TypeScript, Python), 6) Test coverage reporting, 7) Block merge if tests fail or coverage drops below 70%."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-12

- Q: Should the CI/CD pipeline include automated security scanning (SAST, dependency vulnerability checks, secret detection)? → A: Yes - Include security scanning as a blocking check (PR cannot merge if vulnerabilities found)
- Q: What is the expected concurrent pull request volume and runner capacity? → A: Unspecified - Implementation should support typical GitHub Actions free tier limits
- Q: Should the CI/CD pipeline provide a centralized dashboard for monitoring check health and trends? → A: Use existing GitHub Insights/Actions UI as the dashboard (no custom dashboard needed)
- Q: How should the system detect and handle flaky tests (tests with inconsistent pass/fail patterns)? → A: Automatic retry - Retry failed tests up to 3 times; pass if any attempt succeeds, flag test as flaky
- Q: How should the system handle external service failures (e.g., Codecov unavailable, security scanner API down)? → A: Retry with timeout - Retry external services up to 3 times with 30-second intervals; fail-open if all retries exhausted

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automated Test Execution on Pull Requests (Priority: P1)

As a developer, when I create a pull request, the system automatically runs all tests so I can verify my changes don't break existing functionality before requesting review.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of quality gates. Without automated test execution, all other quality checks become meaningless. This provides immediate feedback to developers and prevents broken code from entering the review process.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a pull request with code changes and verifying that all test suites execute automatically within 5 minutes, with results visible in the PR status checks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer has committed code changes to a feature branch, **When** they create a pull request to the main branch, **Then** the test suite executes automatically within 2 minutes
2. **Given** tests are running on a pull request, **When** the developer views the PR page, **Then** they see real-time status indicating "Tests: Running" with progress information
3. **Given** all tests pass successfully, **When** test execution completes, **Then** the PR shows "Tests: Passed" status with execution time and test count
4. **Given** any test fails, **When** test execution completes, **Then** the PR shows "Tests: Failed" status with links to failure details and error logs
5. **Given** a developer pushes additional commits to an open PR, **When** the push completes, **Then** tests automatically re-run for the new commits
6. **Given** a test fails on initial run but passes on retry, **When** test execution completes, **Then** the PR shows "Tests: Passed" status with a warning flagging the specific test as flaky

---

### User Story 2 - Code Quality Validation (Priority: P2)

As a repository maintainer, I need the system to automatically verify code meets quality standards (formatting, style, type safety, security) so reviewers can focus on logic and design rather than catching style violations or security vulnerabilities.

**Why this priority**: Code quality checks catch common issues that waste reviewer time and lead to inconsistent code style. Security scanning prevents vulnerable dependencies and insecure code patterns from entering the codebase. This is secondary to functional correctness (tests) but critical for maintainability and security.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a PR with intentional code quality issues (formatting errors, style violations, type errors, known vulnerable dependencies, hardcoded secrets) and verifying each issue type is detected and reported separately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a PR contains code with formatting violations, **When** quality checks run, **Then** the system reports specific line numbers and formatting issues
2. **Given** a PR contains code with style guideline violations, **When** quality checks run, **Then** the system reports each violation with rule identifiers and suggested fixes
3. **Given** a PR contains code with type safety issues, **When** type checking runs, **Then** the system reports type mismatches with file locations and expected vs actual types
4. **Given** a PR contains security vulnerabilities (vulnerable dependencies, hardcoded secrets, insecure code patterns), **When** security scanning runs, **Then** the system reports each vulnerability with severity level and remediation guidance
5. **Given** all code quality and security checks pass, **When** validation completes, **Then** the PR shows "Code Quality: Passed" status
6. **Given** any quality or security check fails, **When** validation completes, **Then** the PR shows "Code Quality: Failed" status with categorized issues (formatting, style, types, security)
7. **Given** an external service (security scanner) is temporarily unavailable, **When** quality checks run, **Then** the system retries 3 times with 30-second intervals; if still unavailable, marks check as "External Service Unavailable" warning and allows merge to proceed

### User Story 3 - Multi-Language Build Verification (Priority: P3)

As a developer working in a polyglot codebase, I need the system to verify my changes compile and build successfully across all supported languages so I catch build breakages early.

**Why this priority**: Build verification prevents "it works on my machine" problems and ensures changes are deployable. It's lower priority than tests and quality checks because builds often catch fewer issues in interpreted languages.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating PRs with build errors in each supported language (Go, TypeScript, Python) and verifying each language's build process runs and reports failures appropriately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a PR modifies Go source files, **When** build verification runs, **Then** the Go compiler attempts to build the project and reports compilation success or errors
2. **Given** a PR modifies TypeScript files, **When** build verification runs, **Then** the TypeScript compiler builds the project and reports any compilation errors
3. **Given** a PR modifies Python files, **When** build verification runs, **Then** the Python package build process validates import structure and dependencies
4. **Given** all language-specific builds succeed, **When** verification completes, **Then** the PR shows "Build: Passed" status for each language
5. **Given** any build fails, **When** verification completes, **Then** the PR shows "Build: Failed" status with specific error messages and affected files

---

### User Story 4 - Test Coverage Monitoring and Enforcement (Priority: P4)

As a repository maintainer, I need the system to measure test coverage for PR changes and prevent merging if overall coverage drops below 70%, ensuring we maintain quality standards over time.

**Why this priority**: Coverage enforcement maintains long-term code quality but shouldn't block development progress if other checks pass. It's important for technical debt prevention but can be temporarily overridden by maintainers.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating two PRs: one that maintains coverage above 70% (should show passing coverage check) and one that drops coverage below 70% (should show failing coverage check with specific metrics).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a PR includes new code and tests, **When** coverage analysis runs, **Then** the system calculates coverage percentage for the entire codebase including the changes
2. **Given** the overall coverage is 70% or above, **When** coverage check completes, **Then** the PR shows "Coverage: Passed (X%)" status
3. **Given** the overall coverage drops below 70%, **When** coverage check completes, **Then** the PR shows "Coverage: Failed (X%, minimum: 70%)" status
4. **Given** a PR adds new code without tests, **When** coverage analysis runs, **Then** the system highlights which new lines are untested with line-by-line coverage reports
5. **Given** coverage check fails, **When** a maintainer reviews the PR, **Then** they can see coverage trends (before vs after) and uncovered code sections

---

### User Story 5 - Automated Merge Protection (Priority: P5)

As a repository maintainer, I need the system to automatically prevent merging any PR with failing checks so broken code cannot enter protected branches without explicit override.

**Why this priority**: This is the enforcement mechanism that makes all other checks meaningful. It's lowest priority to implement because it's useless without the checks themselves, but it's critical for the system's effectiveness.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to merge PRs with various check statuses and verifying merge is only allowed when all checks pass or an authorized override is used.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a PR has all checks passing (tests, quality, build, coverage), **When** merge is attempted, **Then** the system allows the merge to proceed
2. **Given** a PR has any failing check, **When** merge is attempted by a regular contributor, **Then** the system blocks the merge with a message listing which checks must pass
3. **Given** a PR has failing checks, **When** a repository maintainer attempts merge, **Then** the system shows merge is blocked but displays an override option with warning
4. **Given** checks are still running on a PR, **When** merge is attempted, **Then** the system blocks merge with a message "Checks in progress, please wait"
5. **Given** a PR was previously mergeable but new commits were pushed, **When** the new checks complete, **Then** merge status updates to reflect the latest check results

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the CI/CD system itself experiences an outage or timeout? (System should mark checks as "Status: Error - CI System Unavailable" and allow manual retry, not block indefinitely)
- How does the system handle PRs that modify the CI/CD configuration files themselves? (Must still run checks, but may use previous configuration if new configuration is invalid)
- What happens to in-progress checks when a PR is closed or force-pushed? (System should cancel in-progress checks for obsolete commits to save resources)
- How does coverage enforcement work for PRs that only modify documentation? (System should recognize non-code changes and either skip coverage checks or use previous coverage baseline)
- What happens when a PR spans multiple packages/modules with different coverage baselines? (System should report both overall coverage and per-module coverage, blocking only if overall drops below threshold)
- How are flaky tests handled to prevent false negatives? (System automatically retries failed tests up to 3 times; if any retry succeeds, the test passes but is flagged as flaky for investigation; all 4 failures required to block PR)
- How are false positive security findings handled? (Maintainers must have ability to mark findings as false positives with justification, which excludes them from future scans of same code)
- What happens when external services (Codecov, security scanners) are unavailable? (System retries up to 3 times with 30-second intervals; if all retries fail, marks check as "External Service Unavailable" warning and allows merge with logged failure for audit trail)

- **Check Run**: Represents a single validation execution (test suite run, linter run, build attempt) with status, duration, logs, and outcome
- **Check Suite**: Collection of related check runs for a specific commit, with aggregate status and timestamps
- **Coverage Report**: Contains coverage percentage, line-by-line coverage data, coverage delta compared to base branch, and uncovered line identifiers
- **Merge Status**: Represents the current merge eligibility of a pull request, including which checks must pass, which have passed/failed, and whether override is available
