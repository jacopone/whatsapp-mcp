## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ **COMPLETE** - All workflows implemented
2. ⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED** - Enable branch protection rules:
   - Navigate to repo Settings → Branches → Add rule
   - Require status checks: `test-python`, `code-quality`, `build-go`, `build-typescript`, `sast`, `dependencies`, `secrets`
   - Require 70% coverage check
   - Enable "Restrict who can push to matching branches"
   - Configure maintainer override permissions

### Future Enhancements
3. Add explicit retry mechanism for external services (currently relying on action defaults)
4. Implement critical vs advisory check labeling (currently using `continue-on-error` for advisory only)
5. Track PR lifecycle metrics for SC-007, SC-008, SC-009 validation
