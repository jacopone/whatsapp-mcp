# Feature Specification: WhatsApp Historical Message Sync

**Feature Branch**: `004-implement-whatsapp-deep`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement WhatsApp deep history fetching endpoint in Baileys bridge to sync individual chat messages older than July 2024 using fetchMessageHistory API"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Access Complete Message History for Contact Analysis (Priority: P1)

Users need to analyze their complete WhatsApp conversation history to understand relationship patterns and prioritize contacts. Currently, only messages from July 2024 onwards are available, creating an incomplete picture of long-term relationships.

**Why this priority**: Without historical messages, contact quality scoring and relationship analysis is severely limited. A contact with years of conversation history appears as a recent connection, leading to incorrect prioritization decisions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by requesting historical messages for a specific contact and verifying that messages older than July 2024 are retrieved and stored. Delivers immediate value by enabling accurate contact analysis for that one contact.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a WhatsApp contact with messages dating back to 2020, **When** requesting historical message sync, **Then** messages from 2020-2024 are retrieved and made available for analysis
2. **Given** the system has only messages from July 2024 onwards, **When** historical sync completes, **Then** the date range of available messages extends back to at least 2022 (WhatsApp's typical retention period)
3. **Given** a contact quality score calculated with incomplete data, **When** historical messages are synced, **Then** the quality score is recalculated to reflect the complete conversation history

### User Story 2 - Bulk Historical Sync for All Important Contacts (Priority: P2)

Users need to efficiently sync historical messages for all their important contacts rather than manually triggering sync for each individual contact.

**Why this priority**: While P1 enables the core functionality, manual per-contact syncing is tedious for users with many important relationships. Bulk sync significantly improves user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by providing a list of contact identifiers and verifying all contacts receive historical message syncing in a single operation. Delivers value by saving users from repetitive manual actions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a list of 50 contacts needing historical sync, **When** bulk sync is initiated, **Then** all 50 contacts are queued for historical message retrieval
2. **Given** bulk sync is in progress, **When** checking sync status, **Then** progress information shows how many contacts are complete vs. remaining
3. **Given** some contacts fail during bulk sync, **When** sync completes, **Then** failed contacts are reported with error details and can be retried independently

---

### User Story 3 - Monitor Sync Progress and Handle Errors (Priority: P3)

Users need visibility into the sync process and clear error handling when message retrieval fails or reaches WhatsApp's historical limits.

**Why this priority**: Enhances reliability and user confidence but not critical for core functionality. Users can still benefit from historical messages even without detailed progress tracking.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by monitoring the sync process and intentionally triggering error conditions (e.g., requesting messages older than WhatsApp retains). Delivers value by preventing user confusion about sync status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** historical sync is in progress, **When** querying sync status, **Then** percentage complete and estimated time remaining are provided
2. **Given** WhatsApp has no messages older than a certain date, **When** sync reaches that limit, **Then** the system records the oldest available message date and stops requesting older messages
3. **Given** a network error occurs during sync, **When** the error is transient, **Then** the system automatically retries with exponential backoff

### Edge Cases

- What happens when WhatsApp has deleted messages older than its retention period (typically 1-2 years)?
- How does the system handle rate limiting from WhatsApp's servers during bulk historical requests?
- What happens when a contact's identifier changes between old and new message formats?
- How does the system handle duplicate messages if historical sync overlaps with already-synced recent messages?
- What happens when the system is interrupted mid-sync (power loss, network disconnection)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a way to request historical messages for a specific conversation
- **FR-002**: System MUST retrieve messages older than the current oldest message in the local database
- **FR-003**: System MUST store retrieved historical messages without creating duplicates of already-synced messages
- **FR-004**: System MUST respect WhatsApp's rate limits to avoid service disruptions
- **FR-005**: System MUST track the oldest message date for each conversation to avoid redundant requests
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide status information about ongoing historical sync operations
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle cases where WhatsApp's servers have no older messages available
- **FR-008**: System MUST support syncing multiple conversations in a batch operation
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve message timestamps, sender information, and content during historical sync
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain message ordering chronologically after historical sync

### Key Entities

- **Historical Message**: A WhatsApp message retrieved from before the current sync window, containing timestamp, sender, content, and conversation identifier
- **Sync Request**: A request to retrieve older messages for a specific conversation, tracking the starting point and desired depth
- **Sync Status**: Progress information for ongoing historical sync operations, including completion percentage, errors encountered, and oldest message retrieved

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can access messages from at least 24 months prior for conversations that have existed that long
- **SC-002**: Historical sync for a single conversation with 1000 messages completes within 5 minutes
- **SC-003**: Duplicate messages represent less than 0.1% of synced messages (deduplication is effective)
- **SC-004**: Contact quality scores improve in accuracy by at least 30% when calculated with complete historical data vs. recent-only data
- **SC-005**: Bulk sync operations for 50 conversations complete within 30 minutes
- **SC-006**: System successfully handles WhatsApp rate limiting without disrupting existing message sync functionality
- **SC-007**: Historical sync operations can resume after interruption without data loss or duplicate messages

## Assumptions

- WhatsApp's servers retain messages for approximately 1-2 years depending on user's backup settings
- The existing message database schema can accommodate messages with older timestamps without modification
- Network bandwidth is sufficient for retrieving thousands of historical messages
- Users understand that messages older than WhatsApp's retention period cannot be retrieved
- The system has sufficient storage for the additional historical messages (estimated 2-3x current database size)

## Dependencies

- Existing WhatsApp connection and authentication system must be functional
- Message storage database must be accessible and have sufficient capacity
- WhatsApp's message history APIs must remain available and functional
