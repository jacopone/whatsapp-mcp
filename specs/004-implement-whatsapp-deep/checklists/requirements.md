# Specification Quality Checklist: WhatsApp Historical Message Sync

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - Specification focuses on user needs (contact analysis, relationship patterns) without mentioning specific technologies
✅ **PASS** - Business value clearly articulated (accurate contact scoring, complete conversation history)
✅ **PASS** - Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
✅ **PASS** - All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASS** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
✅ **PASS** - Each functional requirement is testable with clear expected outcomes
✅ **PASS** - Success criteria include specific metrics (24 months, 5 minutes, 0.1%, 30%, 30 minutes)
✅ **PASS** - Success criteria describe user-facing outcomes, not system internals
✅ **PASS** - Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format with clear conditions
✅ **PASS** - Edge cases cover rate limiting, identifier changes, duplicates, interruptions, retention limits
✅ **PASS** - Scope bounded to historical message retrieval (excludes media sync, message editing, etc.)
✅ **PASS** - Dependencies (WhatsApp connection, database, APIs) and assumptions (retention period, storage) documented

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **PASS** - Each FR has corresponding acceptance scenarios in user stories
✅ **PASS** - User scenarios progress from single conversation (P1) to bulk (P2) to monitoring (P3)
✅ **PASS** - Success criteria provide measurable validation of feature completion
✅ **PASS** - Specification maintains abstraction - no mention of Baileys, TypeScript, endpoints, or implementation patterns

## Notes

Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` phase. All quality criteria met on first validation pass.

Key strengths:
- Clear prioritization with independent testability for each user story
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Well-defined success criteria with specific metrics
- Good balance between user value and technical feasibility
